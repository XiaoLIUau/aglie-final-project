# aglie-final-project
A simulated project using ZenHub kanban board apply aglie development practices

## PROJECT SCENARIO  

In this scenario, I play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. As a product owner, I have created stories for my team and organize these stories into a product backlog. As a scrum master, I have created a sprint milestone and make sure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. As a developer, I have created the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint. 

My team has been asked to develop the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. My stakeholders need the ability to create products, retrieve products, update products, and delete products from the catalog. They have also asked for the ability for customers to indicate that they "like a product and have the site display the like count on the product page.” In addition to the catalog functionality, they have asked that it be hosted on a cloud environment with automated deployments. 

My team used ZenHub to provide a kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. As the product owner, I have been driving the process. I need to leverage the skills I learned in the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate to create a new GitHub repository and ZenHub kanban board and fill the kanban board with issues that will become my user stories.
